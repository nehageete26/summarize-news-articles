# summarize-news-articles
Developed a machine learning model to automatically summarize news articles into concise, key points.
This project automatically summarizes long news articles into short and meaningful summaries using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP). The system takes a URL of a news article, extracts its text, cleans it, and then uses an ML-based text summarization model (Sumy) to generate a concise version of the article.

It helps users quickly understand the main points of any news article without reading the entire content.
